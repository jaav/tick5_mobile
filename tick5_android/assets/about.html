<p><b>Double Blind News</b></p>
<p>
We constantly scan all tweets published by a panel of about 2000 multidisciplinary techies, mostly software developers from all over the world. Every 15 minutes on the 15th minute, we filter out the 5 most important/popular entries and publish them here.
</p>
<p>
 - We avoid tweets from journalists and marketeers.<br/>
 - We favor tweets containing typical tech terms, like e.g. 'coffee' or 'regex' or point to tech websites like e.g. github or jsfiddle.
</p>
<p>
This way, we come up with a very limited set of tweets that will be close to what you're interested in.
