You make the news, Double Blind simply filters and displays it.<br/>
Every 15 minutes we scan all tweets published by a panel of about 2000 multidisciplinary software developers from all over 
the world and from all those tweets, we publish just the 5 most important ones every quarter on the quarter.
</p>
<p>
Double Blind is a fun little private project created by VirtualSushi and currently just has a web (desktop and mobile) and an 
Android app interface but other interfaces are under way. 
</p>
<p>
When we say 'software developers', we really mean software developers and not project managers or other staff members 
nor do we follow journalists or marketing people. That's the only way to come up with a limited set of tweets of which 
you can be sure that, if you're a software developer yourself, it will be close to what you're interested in.
</p>
<p>
When we say 'most important', we mean tweets that have been liked or retweeted a lot by members of our panel where more 
recent tweets have more weight then older tweets and where a 'always learning' algorithm uses a growing set of very simple 
parameters to distinct garbage from content.
</p>
<p>
When we say 'multidisciplinary' we mean we follow developers using languages going from the more mainstream HTML5, CSS3, 
JavaScript, Serverside JavaScript, Java, C, C#, Obj.C, Ruby and RoR, PHP, Python or .net up to lesser used (don't kill me) 
languages as LISP, Haskell, F#, Scala, etc. Multidisciplinary also means we're following adepts of SQL or NoSQL, AWS, 
Google AppEngine, Heroku or Linode, BigData or SmallData, ...
